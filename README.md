## The Money Object

The Money class is a **mutable** class, that represent an amount of money. You can add, subtract, multiply and divide the amount in the object with numeric-string or other Money object. Also, the Money Class is Json Serializable and Stringable.

```php
<?php

use TheDevick\PreciseMoney\Calculator\BCMathCalculator;
use TheDevick\PreciseMoney\Money;

$money = new Money('10', new BCMathCalculator(2)); // Start with $10, using the BCMathCalculator with scale 2 (The default is using scale 10)
$money->addMoney(new Money('3')); // Add $3.00
$money->add('5.5'); // Add $5.50

return json_encode($money); // Returns {"amount":"18.50"}
```

### Internally

Internally, the Money object stores the amount in an numeric-string.

## Calculating

Today, we only have the [`BCMathCalculator`](/src/Calculator/BCMathCalculator.php) available, that implements the [`CalculatorInterface`](src/Calculator//CalculatorInterface.php).

## Tests

### Calculator

> [Custom Calculator Test Trait](/tests/TestCase/CalculatorTestCase.php)

To test calculator classes that implements the [Calculator Interface](/src/Calculator/CalculatorInterface.php), you can use the Calculator Test Trait. It have some methods that can help you write your tests:

- `generateCalculatorMessage(CalculatorInterface $calculator)` Returns a nice message that says the Class and Scale of the Calculator. Useful with `$message` argument in assertions.
- `assertCalculatorAddMethod($calculator, $expected, $x, $y)` This methods asserts the calculator add method.
- `assertCalculatorAddMethodComplete($calculator)`nThis methods asserts many operations with the calculator.
